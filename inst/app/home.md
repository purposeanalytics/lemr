# Welcome to the Low-end of Market Rental Monitor 

LEMR is an interactive tool developed to understand changes in the supply of deeply affordable rental housing in the City of Toronto. 

This tool is a proof of concept that demonstrates the potential for linking housing data from multiple sources with a future goal of estimating the volume of deeply affordable housing units, where they are located, and how this is changing over time. 

## Why is this important? 

Housing is becoming increasingly expensive and anecdotal evidence suggests that deeply affordable rental is disappearing faster than new supply is being created. "Deeply affordable" describes private market rental housing units that are affordable to households at the low-end of the income spectrum. A long-standing convention defines housing to be affordable when shelter costs do not exceed 30% of before-tax household income.  

By mapping the dynamics of the low-end of the rental market, LEMR equips policy makers, housing advocates, city planners, government agencies, and researchers with information that can help them to tackle this problem. Access to data is crucial for developing policies, regulation, and programs that protect this important component of the market and advance the right to adequate housing.

LEMR was developed by **<a href = "https://purposeanalytics.ca/" target = "_blank">Purpose Analytics</a>** as a short-listed project through the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation's Housing Supply Challenge Data Driven Round.  

Purpose Analytics is partnering with the Centre for Equality Rights in Accommodation, Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, BC Non-profit Housing Association, Ontario Non-profit Housing Association, and the Community Housing Transformation Centre in applying for second stage funding to scale this proof of concept to major urban areas across Canada.

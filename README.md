# Low-end of Market Rental Monitor

This tool is a proof of concept that demonstrates the potential for
linking housing data from multiple sources with a future goal of
estimating the volume of deeply affordable housing units, where they are
located, and how this is changing over time.

[LEMR](https://lemr.ca/) is an interactive tool developed to
understand changes in the supply of deeply affordable rental housing in
the City of Toronto.

LEMR was developed by [Purpose Analytics](https://purposeanalytics.ca/)
as a short-listed project through the Canada Mortgage Housing
Corporationâ€™s Housing Supply Challenge Data Driven Round.

Purpose Analytics is partnering with the Centre for Equality Rights in
Accommodation, Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, BC Non-profit
Housing Association, Ontario Non-profit Housing Association, and the
Community Housing Transformation Centre in applying for second stage
funding to scale this proof of concept to major urban areas across
Canada.
